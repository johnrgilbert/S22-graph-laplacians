##### Course materials for UCSB CS 292F Spring 2022: Graph Laplacians and Spectral Graph Theory

The main course web site is on [GauchoSpace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/course/view.php?id=15384). Questions, announcements, and discussion are on [Piazza](piazza.com/ucsb/spring2022/cs292/home). Homework and project submissions are via [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/382190).

This repository will be updated throughout the quarter with course materials. You should probably just clone it to your own computer, and do a "git pull" every now and then to keep it up to date. Current contents are:

- [**Index**](Index/): A growing [pdf](Index/index.pdf)/[tex](Index/index.tex) document that includes all the notation and definitions for the course, plus short sketches of many of the results we'll use or prove. It will be updated regularly to keep up with lectures.
- [**Readings**](Readings/): This directory contains the textbook, which is Dan Spielman's "Spectral and Algebraic Graph Theory", plus papers from the literature that will be assigned as reading.
- [**LectureMaterials**](LectureMaterials/): This directory contains the materials I use or generate in lecture, including Matlab transcripts and figures and any slides. I will also put in the ipad images from the online offering of this course last year; they won't correspond exactly to this year's lectures but they may be useful for reference.
- [**Homework**](Homework/): This directory contains all the homework assignments, including LaTeX source, and any auxiliary files needed for assignments. Homework and project submissions are via [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/382190).
- [**Projects**](Projects/): This directory's README.md has the policy and schedule for the final projects, and some suggested topics. It will eventually also contain all the project proposals and final project reports.
- [**Data**](Data/): This directory contains example graphs and some information about them, in several formats.
- [**Julia**](Julia/): This directory contains my custom Julia software for the class. There's not much there; most of our Julia software will be from [Dan Spielman's Laplacians.jl](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl) package, which you should download and install for yourself.
- [**Matlab**](Matlab/): This directory contains my custom Matlab software for the class, which I will use in demos from time to time. You don't have to run any of this unless you want to.
